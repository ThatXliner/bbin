# Contributing

First off, I am so glad you want to contribute!

Now secondly, you're probably wondering *how* you can contribute.

Well, you can make PRs that implement new features or fix bugs. Or, you can request some new features in the issue tracker.

## Style

For consistent code style, smaller diffs, and the higher chance your changes will not be written over, you should follow our conventions.

### Python code style

Python code style can be found [here][py]. The thing is, if you don't want to read it, the golden rule is to **just use [black][black]**.

### Markdown style

We actually have no style-guide here, so let your internal artistic self flow!

## Meta style

### Git commit messages

We follow the GitMoji convention. Also, prefer to use past-tense (e.g. "Updated", "Fixed") in the commit messages.

Try to add a description if possible.

### GitHub comment conventions

When commenting on GitHub (issues and PRs), the golden rule is to **only comment if it adds to the conversation**. In other words, if you find yourself saying stuff like "Ok" or "+1" or "Got it, thanks!", you should be using **GitHub reactions**.
